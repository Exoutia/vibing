This is my application for making different things in flask and publish it in the wild to do anything.

1. TODO
2. Meditation
3. View

Create the login flow and index page for the user.

1. If the user is logged in the user can directly go to the user index page with three section blog section, todo and meditation section.
2. If the user is not logged and trying to visit some site specifically meant for the user only then he/she should be redirected to the login page with the option to go the the registration page.
3. The user should have the option to logout also.
